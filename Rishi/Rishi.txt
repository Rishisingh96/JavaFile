What is Compile time polymorphism (Static polymorphism)?
A polymorphism where object binding with methods happens at compile time is called static polymorphism or compile-time polymorphism.
In static polymorphism, the behavior of the method is decided at compile-time based on the parameters or arguments of the method.
How to achieve or implement static polymorphism in Java?
Static polymorphism can be achieved by method overloading. Other examples of compile time polymorphism are constructor overloading and method hiding.
