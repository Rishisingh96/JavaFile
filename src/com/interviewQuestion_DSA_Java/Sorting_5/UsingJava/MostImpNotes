✅ Best 8 Sorting Algorithms (With Use Case + Time + Space)
#	Sorting Algorithm	Time Complexity (Best / Avg / Worst)	Space	Stable	Use Case
1	Bubble Sort	O(n) / O(n²) / O(n²)	O(1)	✅ Yes	Basic learning, almost never used in real apps
2	Selection Sort	O(n²) / O(n²) / O(n²)	O(1)	❌ No	Simple logic, less used
3	Insertion Sort	O(n) / O(n²) / O(n²)	O(1)	✅ Yes	Works well for small arrays or nearly sorted data
4	Merge Sort	O(n log n) / O(n log n) / O(n log n)	O(n)	✅ Yes	Best for linked lists or external sorting
5	Quick Sort	O(n log n) / O(n log n) / O(n²)	O(log n)	❌ No	Best for arrays, widely used in libraries (e.g., C’s qsort())
6	Heap Sort	O(n log n) / O(n log n) / O(n log n)	O(1)	❌ No	Great when memory is limited
7	Counting Sort	O(n + k)	O(k)	✅ Yes	For small range integers (0 to k), very fast
8	Radix Sort	O(nk)	O(n + k)	✅ Yes	For large integers or strings (used in phone numbers, etc.)

🧠 Which One to Use?
Scenario	Recommended Sorting
Small arrays / educational	Bubble / Selection / Insertion
Fastest guaranteed performance	Merge Sort
Memory efficient	Heap Sort
Real-world general sorting	Quick Sort
Sorting with limited range values	Counting / Radix
External file sorting	Merge Sort
Stable & non-comparison based	Counting, Radix

🔥 Quick One-Liner Summary:
🔁 Bubble Sort – slowest but simplest

🧲 Selection Sort – selects min/max each round

📌 Insertion Sort – like sorting playing cards

🧬 Merge Sort – divide and conquer (always O(n log n))

⚡ Quick Sort – fastest in practice (pivot-based)

🏔️ Heap Sort – great when no extra memory allowed

📊 Counting Sort – O(n) when range is small

🧮 Radix Sort – best for integers, strings by digit/char

✅ Practice Order (Interview Preparation):
Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Counting Sort

Radix Sort

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

🔰 Bonus Tip:
Use Arrays.sort() in Java → internally uses:

TimSort (Hybrid of Merge + Insertion)

Fast and stable.
