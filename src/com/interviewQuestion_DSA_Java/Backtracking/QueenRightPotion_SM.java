Let's walk through the dry run of the QueenRightPotion_SM class, which solves the N-Queens problem using backtracking. The N-Queens problem is about placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

The example provided uses n = 4, which means the board is 4x4 and we're solving the 4-Queens problem.

Code Breakdown
isSafe method: Checks if it's safe to place a queen at a given position on the board.

Vertical Up: Checks the column above the current position.
Diagonal Left Up: Checks the diagonal to the top-left.
Diagonal Right Up: Checks the diagonal to the top-right.
nQueens method: Tries to place queens row by row.

If all rows are processed (row == board.length), the board is printed as a solution.
For each column in the current row, it checks if placing a queen is safe using the isSafe method.
If safe, the queen is placed (board[row][j] = 'Q') and the method is called recursively to place a queen in the next row.
After returning from recursion, it removes the queen (board[row][j] = 'x') to backtrack and try other positions.
printBoard method: Prints the current board configuration.

main method: Initializes the board and starts the process by calling nQueens(board, 0).

Dry Run
We start with an empty 4x4 board:

Step 1: Place the first queen in Row 0.
Column 0: Safe, place queen.

Call nQueens(board, 1) to place the next queen in Row 1.
Step 2: Place the second queen in Row 1.
Column 0: Not safe (vertical conflict with Q at (0, 0)).
Column 1: Not safe (diagonal left conflict with Q at (0, 0)).
Column 2: Safe, place queen.

Call nQueens(board, 2) to place the next queen in Row 2.
Step 3: Place the third queen in Row 2.
Column 0: Not safe (vertical conflict with Q at (0, 0)).
Column 1: Not safe (diagonal right conflict with Q at (1, 2)).
Column 2: Not safe (vertical conflict with Q at (1, 2)).
Column 3: Safe, place queen.

Call nQueens(board, 3) to place the next queen in Row 3.
Step 4: Place the fourth queen in Row 3.
Column 0: Not safe (vertical conflict with Q at (0, 0)).
Column 1: Not safe (diagonal right conflict with Q at (2, 3)).
Column 2: Not safe (diagonal left conflict with Q at (1, 2)).
Column 3: Not safe (vertical conflict with Q at (2, 3)).
No position is safe in Row 3. Backtrack by removing the queen from Row 2, Column 3, and continue trying the next position in Row 1.

Backtrack to Row 1, continue placing the second queen.
Remove Queen at (1, 2):

All queens are placed safely. This is one solution to the 4-Queens problem. The board is printed, and the function will continue to backtrack to explore other possible solutions.

The program will continue this backtracking process until all possible solutions are found.

Output
For n = 4, there are 2 possible solutions. The program will print both configurations: 1.

Each configuration represents a valid solution where no two queens can attack each other.
