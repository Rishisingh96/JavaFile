/*Sure, I can provide a sample output for five products based on the given code. Hereâ€™s an example:

### Sample Run:

```
Enter the product ID for product 1:
101
Enter the price of product 1:
500
Enter the quantity of product 1:
3
Enter the product ID for product 2:
102
Enter the price of product 2:
700
Enter the quantity of product 2:
2
Enter the product ID for product 3:
103
Enter the price of product 3:
600
Enter the quantity of product 3:
4
Enter the product ID for product 4:
104
Enter the price of product 4:
1000
Enter the quantity of product 4:
1
Enter the product ID for product 5:
105
Enter the price of product 5:
800
Enter the quantity of product 5:
2

Product with the highest price has ID: 104
Total amount spent on all products: 8100
```

### Explanation of Sample Output:
1. **Product Information Input**:
    - **Product 1**: ID = 101, Price = 500, Quantity = 3
    - **Product 2**: ID = 102, Price = 700, Quantity = 2
    - **Product 3**: ID = 103, Price = 600, Quantity = 4
    - **Product 4**: ID = 104, Price = 1000, Quantity = 1
    - **Product 5**: ID = 105, Price = 800, Quantity = 2

2. **Finding Product with the Highest Price**:
    - The product with the highest price is Product 4 (ID = 104) with a price of 1000.

3. **Calculating Total Amount Spent**:
    - **Product 1**: 500 * 3 = 1500
    - **Product 2**: 700 * 2 = 1400
    - **Product 3**: 600 * 4 = 2400
    - **Product 4**: 1000 * 1 = 1000
    - **Product 5**: 800 * 2 = 1600
    - **Total**: 1500 + 1400 + 2400 + 1000 + 1600 = 7900

This example provides a detailed run-through of how the program captures the product information, determines the product with the highest price, and calculates the total amount spent on all products. The output may vary based on the actual input values provided during the run.
