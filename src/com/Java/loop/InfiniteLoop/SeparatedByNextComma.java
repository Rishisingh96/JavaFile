/*1. The for loop can have more than one initialization expression and iteration expression. This feature cannot apply in other loops. Each expression must be separated from the next by a comma. Letâ€™s take one more example program based on this point.*/

        int x, y;
        for(x = 1, y = 5; x<y; x++, y--) {
